### #116, C2: loosening with new solutions for the unsolvable cuts
original cut:

```
116-Cut2-before
television - 0.1.1
| +- django(version range:>=3.0, <=3.0.14)
| | +- asgiref(version range:~=3.2)
| +- channels(version range:==1.1.8)
| | +- asgiref(version range:~=1.1)
```




loosened cut:

```
